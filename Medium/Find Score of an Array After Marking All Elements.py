https://leetcode.com/problems/find-score-of-an-array-after-marking-all-elements

1. Put all elements into a doubly linked list, so that each one can access its neighbors
2. Put each node into an array and sort by value
3. From smallest to largest, pick each node and mark its neighbors. Skip marked nodes.
4. Return the sum of all picked nodes.

TC: O(NlogN) for sorting
SC: O(N) for the linked list and array

After seeing other O(N) solutions.
One-pass greedy approach. Think of the array as several strictly increasing and
decreasing subarrays put together.

An important observation is that if a number is less than both its neigbors,
it will always be picked for the sum.

For the increasing arrays, we can greedily pick the first element in it
and then every other element. Because the first element will be smaller
than the one before and after it, so it will be guaranteed to be part of
the answer (or if its the first element in the whole array).

For the decreasing arrays, we can put them in a stack as we traverse. When
we find the first element that is not strictly decreasing (that is >= prev element), 
then we know that the element right before that is a local minimum (less than
both its neighbors), and therefore needs to be part of the answer. If we 
elimnate that one, then the one right before it gets eliminated also, and the
one before that one will be the next minimum, because it has a greater element
to its left and a cancelled element to its right. So it needs to be part of
the answer and we add it. Since the array is strictly decreasing, this just
repeats for every other element every time. We essentially do the same thing 
we did for the increasing arrays, but backwards.

After processing all numbers, there may be some still in the stack, so we process
those and return the final answer.

TC: O(N). One pass through the array.
SC: O(N). For the stack.
