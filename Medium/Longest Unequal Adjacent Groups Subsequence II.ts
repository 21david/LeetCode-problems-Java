Work backwards. The last word has a "longest path forward" of 0 since it there are no more words.
Start from the second last word and check every word after it for the longest chain. Record
the longest chain and the index that gives the longest chain in arrays. Repeat this, traversing
left, until doing all words. Always keep track of the overall maximum longest chain of words
and the index where it started. Then, we can use those to reconstruct the longest chain that
was found.
