"""
Solution 1:
Go from left to right, and between every 2 numbers, try the following operations: join, add, subtract, multiply.
Join will just combine two numbers, like 1 and 2 into 12. Try all combinations of these 4 operations for all digits in the number,
and this will create every possible valid expression with every possible set of operands and operators.
This is basically a brute force approach, which is necessary because we can't know what the final result of an expression will be 
without trying. For each attempt, once we reach the end of the string and have an expression, we evaluate it, and if it evaluates 
to the target, we keep the expression in an array that is returned at the end. Then, we filter out the solutions that have a
number with a leading 0.
Time complexity: O(4^N * N) because each recursive call makes 4 recursive calls, which creates a tree.
At the base cases (about 4^(N-1) of these), O(N) work is performed to evaluate the expression.
Space complexity: O(4^N * N). In the worst case, nearly all 4^(N-1) attempted expressions will
be a valid expression, and each expression will take space for anywhere between N and 2N-1 characters.
The space complexity used for the stack is O(N).
This attempt exceeds the time limit on LeetCode because of the functions to evaulate the expression at the end. See the next 
solution for an approach that passes.

"""
Solution 2:
The same approach as above, but as we are building the expressions, we calculate the current value
of it, instead of calculating each one at the end. We also check for and avoid leading 0s as we're
building the expression.
To evaluate the expression as we're going, we must do something different when multiplying than when
adding or subtracting because of the priority of multiplication (PEMDAS). One way to do this is to 
keep track of the previous operand (the last one that has been fully read). With that, if you need 
that operand for a multiplication rather than a sum or subtraction, then you can undo it from the 
current expression value (stored in a variable), use it for the multiplication, and then recalculate 
the total. The exception to this is that when multiplying, it should accumulate the product of 
multiple multiplications in a row for it to work.

Time complexity: O(4^N * N) because each recursive call makes 4 recursive calls, which creates a tree.
Each recursive call creates a new string, which is an O(N) operation because strings are immutable.

Space complexity: O(4^N * N). In the worst case, nearly all 4^(N-1) attempted expressions will
be a valid expression, and each expression will take space for anywhere between N and 2N-1 characters.
The space complexity used for the stack is O(N).
